It's an interpreted language thats compiled at runtime, is weakly typed supports object-oriented, functional and imperative programming styles. The goal of Skrypt is to create an easy to use scripting language that combines familiar ideas and syntax from other languages. Skrypt includes has an extensive standard library and extensive interoperability with .NET.

                    <p class="lead text-light">Fright Night is a 2D, top-down horror game in which you must find and escape from a school with
                        as many of your friends as possible, while trying to survive the presence of a killer clown.
                        The player can make use of various items to fend off the clown. <br><br>
                        With this project I learned a lot about designing <b>game AI</b> which is used for the killer clown 
                        and in-game friends.

                        nest hanging lower in the tree. The bees get angry at Bubba and try to attack him. Bubba must
                        now flee from all the bees. As Bubba flees, he encounters various obstacles, such as bees,
                        giant rainworms, and more bee’s nests. </p>

                    <p class="lead text-light">Seat of Burden was a collaborative game-project that aimed to teach the player about cultural
                        awareness. It's set in an imaginary medieval realm; Culturia. The premise of the game is that
                        you're the son of a king who died. The king hasn't ruled Culturia in the way that suited it's
                        inhabitants. As the new king of Culturia, you aim to restore the realm to it's former glory.
                        <br><br> I was tasked with most of the development work. Because I was only using a single 
                        library to render items dynamically, I didn't have robust base to work on such as an actual 
                        game engine. This meant I basically had to write a <b>card game engine</b> from scatch.</p>

                        learn a bit of Python (another programming language), so I decided to make my own Brainf***
