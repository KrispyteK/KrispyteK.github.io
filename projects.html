                        To educate more people about energy consumption and waste, I set out to build a mobile VR game together with 5 other students. The premise of this game is that aliens are invading the world because they need energy for themselves. However, they can only get this energy by letting the player's devices waste more energy. This teaches the player that they should be more aware of their energy consumption, and also which devices consume the most energy.<br><br>
